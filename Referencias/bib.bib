abstract={The required level of detail (LOD) of a three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) model differs according to its purpose. It is therefore important that users are able to simplify a highly complex 3D CAD model and create a low-complexity one. The simplification of a 3D CAD model requires the application of a simplification operation and evaluation metrics for the geometric elements of the 3D CAD model. The evaluation metrics are used to select those elements that should be removed. The simplification operation removes selected elements in order to simplify the 3D CAD model. In this paper, we propose the graph-based simplification of feature-based 3D CAD models using a method that preserves connectivity. First, new evaluation metrics that consider the discrimination priority among several simplification criteria are proposed. Second, a graph-based refined simplification operation that prevents the separation of a feature-based 3D CAD model into multiple volumes is proposed. Finally, we verify the proposed method by implementing a prototype system and performing simplification experiments using feature-based 3D CAD models.},

@phdthesis{PerezGarcia2014,
abstract = {This final project is framed within the context of co-design. The concept of co-design can be defined as “a process of creative collaboration between designers and people, which have no previous training in design, in order to solve meaningful problems”. Within this context, there exists a recent trend of development of technological tools that improve the process of design. However, the support of the co-design processes carried out in a distributed and/or synchronous manner presents a challenge to be solved.
 It is often necessary that this process of co-design can be performed in a distributed manner in order to facilitate the participation of people from different locations. Similarly, there is a need to obtain design resources remotely. In particular, the participants may want to get multimedia resources even if these are not in the same design space. Accordingly, it is necessary to assist the co-design process in a distributed manner and to ensure that, in both cases, there is a need of coordination for the data access.
 In order to address these requirements, this final project provides a technological environment that supports the co-design process. In particular, the contributions of this project are related to both the assistance of building affinity diagrams in a distributed manner and collecting multimedia information remotely. With this purpose, this project extends the functionality of a design tool called ColDes by allowing to create a new type of design room that support the creation of affinity diagrams in a distributed manner. The participants can now create and share design ideas by adding information item related to the problem established in the design process. These information items can be organized into groups of similar ideas that are meaningful to the resolution of the problem. In this way, it is obtained a visual representation of the first draft of the design solution. Aiming at allowing obtaining multimedia resources remotely, it has been developed a mobile application. The participants can take photos and videos from anywhere and add them to the affinity diagram. These resources can be used to reinforce ideas of the affinity diagram, since it is possible to associate them to the information items created in the affinity diagram workspace of ColDes.
 To conclude, all the information stored in the ColDes system has been made persistent. The participants can save an affinity diagram at any time, and recover it later to continue the design. They, therefore, can perform their work in an affinity diagram in a discontinued manner. Since several users can simultaneously access the system resources, some collaboration policies have been introduced to ensure the consistency of the data in cases where the process is performed in a distributed and/or synchronous manner.},

@article{Sanders2008,
abstract = { Designers have been moving increasingly closer to the future users of what they design and the next new thing in the changing landscape of design research has become co-designing with your users. But co-designing is actually not new at all, having taken distinctly different paths in the US and in Europe. The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the roles of the designer, the researcher and the person formerly known as the ‘user'. The implications of this shift for the education of designers and researchers are enormous. The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the landscape of design practice as well, creating new domains of collective creativity. It is hoped that this evolution will support a transformation toward more sustainable ways of living in the future. },

@misc{Tek-JinNam2009,
abstract = {This paper presents a collaborative 3D workspace that makes use of newly developed interaction techniques for synchronous distributed product design reviews. These new techniques were developed to enhance collaboration in regard to shared objects and shared workspaces. The requirements for such collaboration were determined through literature review and an observational study. An augmented reality based collaborative design workspace was developed in which the interaction techniques, the use of Sync-turntables and Virtual Shadows, were created to support shared manipulation, awareness of the actions of remote participants, and tele-presence. The Sync-turntable is a rotating synchronized table that provides intuitive physical representation of shared virtual 3D models. It also provides a physical cue of the remote participants' manipulation. Virtual Shadows project body and hand silhouettes of remote participants which provides natural and continuous awareness of the location, gestures and pointing of collaborators. A lab-based user study was conducted, and the results show that these interaction techniques support awareness of general pointing and facilitate discussion in 3D product design reviews. The proposed workspace and interaction techniques are expected to facilitate more natural communication and to increase the efficiency of collaboration on virtual 3D models between distributed participants (designer-designer, engineer, or modeler) in collaborative design environments.},

In this synthesis of his seminal research, von Hippel challenges that basic assumption and demonstrates that innovation occurs in different places in different industries. Presenting a series of studies showing that end-users, material suppliers, and others are the typical sources of innovation in some fields, von Hippel explores why this variation in the "functional" sources of innovation occurs and how it might be predicted. He also proposes and tests some implications of replacing a manufacturer-as-innovator assumption with a view of the innovation process as predictably distributed across users, manufacturers, and suppliers. Innovation, he argues, will take place where there is greatest economic benefit to the innovator.},

abstract = {A sole company cannot accomplish the full design of most products (automobiles, aeroplanes or space vehicles), even if the company is a big one. Engineering suppliers are needed to develop the full product. Product development is understood as a continuous process of knowledge collection over a set of tasks, and their relationships. Those tasks must be performed for obtaining the information about how is the product, how must be manufactured, how must be used, how must be maintained, how must be recycled, and whatever other aspect related to the product lifecycle. However, talking about industrial products, design cannot be considered as isolated of other important enterprise issues, such as market demand, standards and rules, buying requirements, available manufacturing processes and maintenance service. Design is a critical task in the product development process, because it provides with all the information defining next steps to the final manufacturing of the product. It can be stated that the maximum efficiency is achieved upon an adequate process supported by design engineering techniques and tools. Thus, the simultaneous combination of process and tools results in enhanced product final competitiveness. To use a proven methodology, and specific tools, in a Collaborative Engineering environment is becoming a fundamental issue, that allows for practical development of highly complex projects, from technical to organisational point of view.},

abstract = {This paper discusses parametric design systems as a generative tool in architectural design. Parametric tools are algorithmically based, and therefore offer increased computational control over design geometry during design activity. Their adaptability and responsiveness to changingdesign criteria and requirements make parametric models especially useful for design exploration in complex and dynamic design settings. In performance based design, parametric control of form is particularlyvaluable, such that they allow the integration of performance analysis into design synthesis. However, parametric systems are often incorrectly mistaken as an emerging architectural style rather than a computational method, ascribing it a false skin-deep character that overshadows its true merits. Moreover, parametric models come with a price, posing limitations regarding representational flexibility and design complexity, which hindereffective design exploration. A critical awareness on both the potentials and limitations of parametric systems is therefore critical in their effective use during design.},

The framework consists of four parts: client databases, an index server, a CAD data format translator, and a file sharing control module. The architecture can be either built on the Internet or on intranet of a company. The CAD data format translator is developed to translate files of different formats into the STEP format. Using this framework and the STEP translator, CAD/CAM users can share their design files in a convenient way.

In this new model, the single-page Web interface is composed of individual components which can be updated/replaced independently. If until a year ago, the concern revolved around migrating legacy systems to Web-based settings, today we have a new challenge of migrating Web applications to single-page Ajax applications. Gaining an understanding of the navigational model and user interface structure of the source application is the first step in the migration process. In this paper, we explore how reverse engineering techniques can help analyze classic Web applications for this purpose. Our approach, using a schema-based clustering technique, extracts a navigational model of Web applications, and identifies candidate user interface components to be migrated to a single-page Ajax interface. Additionally, results of a case study, conducted to evaluate our tool, are presented},

abstract="Because eManufacturing is motivated by the emerging need for distant collaborative design required among R{\&}D centres and manufacturers of global-based enterprises, web-based product data management becomes an essential tool for realising the technology. In this paper, the design of a web-basedproductdatamanagement (WPDM) system is presented. The developed WPDM is aimed at achieving the goal of eManufacturing by providing an effective tool for product database management through the Internet utilising JAVA and J2EE technologies. In our scenarios, all the involved engineering and management team members who need WPDM are inherently located dispersedly. The ultimate goal is to optimise product cycle time and upgrade a traditional PDM system to face the challenge of the new era of global business competition. Basically, the proposed WPDM is developed in such a way that it allows designers/users to create, view and manipulate product data through the World Wide Web, while founding the architecture of the web application on a three-tier client/server system. The current WPDM of our design mainly uses servlets and JSP to handle user inputs and manage and retrieve product data from the database through the JDBC driver, with the server components stored on a middleware program called Tomcat. Within this environment, all parties involved in product design and manufacture can access the WPDM log-in page with the given URL after a successful identity authorisation. Consequently, these users can create, search and/or manipulate the desired engineering data through the enabled WPDM. The WPDM developed in this work has been experimentally tested in the lab. ",

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to discuss the relevance of including the discipline of computer programming in the architectural curriculum. It starts by explaining how computer programming has been applied in other educational contexts with pedagogical success, describing Seymour Papert's principles. After that, the historical development of CAD is summarized and three historical examples of educational applications of computer programming in architecture are presented, followed by a contemporary case of particular relevance. Next, a methodology for teaching programming for architects that aims at improving the quality of designs by making their concepts more explicit is proposed. This methodology is based on the author´s experience teaching computer programming for architecture students at undergraduate and graduate levels at the State University of Campinas, Brazil. The paper ends with a discussion about the role of programming nowadays, when most CAD software are user-friendly. As a conclusion, it is suggested that the introduction of programming in the CAD curriculum within a proper conceptual framework may transform the concept of architectural education. Key-words:},

@article{SpitzRappoportA.b2004,
abstract = {Data exchange between CAD systems is an extremely important solid modeling concept, fundamental both for the theory of the field and for its practical applications. The two main data exchange (DE) paradigms are geometric and parametric DE. Geometric DE is the ordinary method, in which the boundary representation of the object is exchanged. Parametric (or feature-based) DE is a novel method where, given a parametric history (feature) graph in a source system, the goal is to construct a graph in the target system that results in similar geometry while preserving as much parametric information as possible. Each method has its uses and associated problems. In this paper, we introduce Geometry Per Feature (GPF), a method for integration of parametric and geometric data exchange at the single part (object) level. Features can be exchanged either parametrically or geometrically, according to user guidelines and system constraints. At the target system, the resulting model is represented using a history tree, regardless of the amount of original parametric features that have been rewritten as geometric ones. Using this method we maximize the exchange of overall parametric data and overcome one of the main stumbling blocks for feature-based data exchange.

@article{Zunke2014,
abstract = {– Service Oriented Architecture is integrated in the very fabric of the nature of Internet. The Internet as it exists today is made up of numerous components which operate asynchronously. These independent components communicate with each other using a specific set of formats that standardize the communication and regulate the coherence of the communication. The SOA structure is made up of multiple loosely coupled components that can be broadly classified as service producers and service consumers. The loose coupling allows enterprises to respond to changes quickly by updating, replacing and changing concerned modules with flexibility, without affecting other components coupled to it. This paper first compares the features of the two most widely used Data Exchange formats for communication between these components and finally, provides a comparative analysis on the performance of these formats using benchmarks.},

@article{Waerner2012,
abstract = {Web applications are becoming increasingly sophisticated and functionality that was once exclusive to regular desktop applications can now be found in web applications as well. One of the more recent advances in this field is the ability for web applications to render 3D graphics. Coupled with the growing number of devices with graphics processors and the ability of web applications to run on many different platforms using a single code base, this represents an exciting new possibility for developers of 3D graphics applications. This thesis aims to explore and evaluate the technologies for 3D graphics that can be used in web applications, with the final goal of using one of them in a prototype application. This prototype will serve as a foundation for an application to be included in a commercial product. The evaluation is performed using general criteria so as to be useful for other applications as well, with one part presenting the available technologies and another part evaluating the three most promising technologies more in-depth using test programs. The results show that, although some technologies are not production-ready, there are a few which can be used in commercial software, including the three chosen for further evaluation; WebGL, the Java library JOGL and Stage 3D for Flash. Among these, there is no clear winner and it is up to the application requirements to decide which to use. The thesis demonstrates an application built with WebGL and shows that fairly demanding 3D graphics web applications can be built. Also included are the lessons learned during the development and thoughts on the future of 3D graphics in web applications.},

@book{Fallis2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Digital manufacturing has been considered, over the last decade, as a highly promising set of technologies for reducing product development times and cost as well as for addressing the need for customization, increased product quality, and faster response to the market. This paper describes the evolution of information technology systems in manufacturing, outlining their characteristics and the challenges to be addressed in the future. Together with the digital manufacturing and factory concepts, the technologies considered in this paper include computer-aided design, engineering, process planning and manufacturing, product data and life-cycle management, simulation and virtual reality, automation, process control, shopfloor scheduling, decision support, decision making, manufacturing resource planning, enterprise resource planning, logistics, supply chain management, and e-commerce systems. These technologies are discussed in the context of the digital factory and manufacturing concepts.},

Modelado de s{\'{o}}lidos En muchas aplicaciones los elementos que se dise{\~{n}}an representan objetos f{\'{i}}sicos tridimensionales, de los que es necesario calcular propiedades tales como su peso, su volumen o su momento de inercia.
